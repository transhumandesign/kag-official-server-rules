	<h1 style="float: left;">KAG Official Server Rules</h1>
	<h2 style="float: right;">Last updated 01/08/2019</h2>
	<hr style="clear: both;">
	<p>
		By playing on King Arthur's Gold official servers, you agree to obey the rules listed below and incur any penalties
		given by server admins if your behaviour goes against them in any way. Official Server Admins should refer to this
		document to ensure they are providing fair, informed outcomes to all in-game situations.
	</p>

	<p>
		It is the player's responsibility to keep up to date with these rules as they may be modified without notice.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you see a player breaking any of these rules, you can report them in-game using <code>!r (KAG username)</code> in the chat box,
		or tagging an admin with <b>@Ingame Server Admin</b> in the <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/kag">Official Discord</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you believe you have been wrongly punished, you may appeal the ban by posting in the appropriate forum thread:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://forum.thd.vg/threads/21688/">Banned from an official server</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://forum.thd.vg/threads/1713/">Banned globally from all servers</a></li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		Penalties given can be classified into three categories:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<p>
			<b>Minor:</b> Minor penalties are typically the result of first offences. These include any warnings, mutes, hiding
			nicknames, kicks, or short-term bans (typically a few hours).
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Moderate:</b> Moderate penalties result from an escalation of minor level penalties, warnings, or the nature of the
			offence (for example griefing.)  They typically include longer mutes or bans.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Severe:</b> Severe penalties involve longer bans, typically without prior warning. A severe penalty is applied as
			a result of prior offences, or simply the nature of the offence (for example, hacking).<br>
			A severe penalty also includes global or permanent bans, or as the result of <a href="#evasion">punishment evasion</a>.
		</p>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Reports are dealt with at the admin's discretion. Repeat rule-breakers may incur harsher penalties than those listed under each rule.
	</p>
